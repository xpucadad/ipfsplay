<h1>Hello L4R World!</h1>
<p>This web page is being served from the ipfs p2p network. This is, there
  is no single server on which it is hosted.</p>
<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>It appears that files added to this network disappear after some time. I keep having to re-add and re-publish this page to keep it available.</p>
<h2>Here is the setup:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The page source is in the file website/index.html.</li>
<li>The website folder is added to ipfs, generating a hash $WEBSITE_HASH: "ipfs add -r website". The -r will recurse to all files in the website folder.</li>
<li>The hash is published to the peer id: "ipfs name publish ipfs/$WEBSITE_HASH"</li>
<li>A DNS Cname record is created to map ipfstest.looking4.net to gateway.ipfs.io.</li>
<li>A DNS Text record is created which maps the site url prepended with the special ipfs "_dnslink.", "_dnslink.ipfstest.looking4reality.net", to "dnslink=ipns/$PEER_ID".</li>
</ul>
<h2>The page is retrieved as follows:</h2>
<ol>
<li>User provivdes the following URL to a browser: http://ipfstest.looking4reality.net</li>
<li>Browser asks dns for the information for the URL.</li>
<li>DNS uses the Cname to get the target url "gateway.ipfs.io", and returns it and the text record that defines the special _dnslink to the browser.</li>
<li>The browser sends the request to gateway.ipfs.io (from Cname) along with the special _dnslink text record.</li>
<li>The gateway gets the ipns dnslink from the text record and uses this to retrieve the peer id.</li>
<li>The gateway uses the peer id to look up the published hash ($WEBSITE_HASH above) using ipns.</li>
<li>The gateway retrieves the ipfs content using hash and returns it to the browser.</li>
<li>The browser renders the site.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Updating the site</h2>
<p>To update the site:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The content of the site (in the website folder) is updated.</li>
  <li>A new $WEBSITE_HASH is generated by adding the website to IPFS: "ipfs add -r website".</li>
  <li>The new $WEBSITE_HASH is published to the peer id: "ipfs name publish ipfs/$WEBSITE_HASH".</li>
  <li>The updated site should now be served for http://ipfstest.looking4reality.net.</li>
</ol>
